# user_assignment

For this assignment you will create the user class and add a couple methods!

Attributes:
On instantiation of a user, the following attributes should be passed in as arguments:

first_name
last_name
email
age

Also include default attributes:

is_rewards_member - default value of False
gold_card_points = 0
Methods:

display_info(self) - Have this method print all of the users' details on separate lines.
enroll(self) - Have this method change the user's member status to True and set their gold card points to 200.
spend_points(self, amount) - have this method decrease the user's points by the amount specified.

Ninja Bonuses:

Add logic in the enroll method to check if they are a member already, and if they are, print "User already a member." and return False, otherwise return True.
Add logic in the spend points method to be sure they have enough points to spend that amount and handle appropriately.
